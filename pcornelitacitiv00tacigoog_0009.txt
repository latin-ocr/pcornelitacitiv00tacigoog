iv Introduction.

the events of the years 68 and 69 in the HistorieS, appears to
' be that os an eye-witness ; isso, we cannot suppose him to
have been less than fifteen at that date. Another consideration
is that Tacitus was praetor ab. 88, which was the first year he
could have held that office, under the rules os the Republic, if
he had been born in 51. These rules were, it is true, no longer
in force 3 neverthelcss, it is reasonable to suppose that they
still exerted some influence, and that this office would not be
held much before the traditional age. It may be added that
Pliny was probably not far from fifty-five when he made use of

the expression propemodum⁴ aequales,· and that this term might

apply very well to two men of fifty-five and sixty-three or five.
He probably died about A.D. 116.

Of the events of his life very little is known. He married the
daughter os Agricola in the year nn. 78 (Chap. IX.), and it
hasbeen conjectured that he was a member of his military
family during his administration of Aquitania the three previous
years. He was praetor nn. 88, and was afterwards absent from
Rome for four years, during which period his father-in-law died,
no. 93 (Chap. XLV.). He was consul under Nerva, nn. 97.
We learn from several passages in Pliny that he was a distin-
guished lawyer and orator, as well as historiari.

It is almost by accident that we possess the writings ol Taci-
tus, for the manuscripts in which they have come down to us
are very few, and badly mutilated. These writings are: 1. The
Dialogue of Orators (De Oratoribus), an early composition, so
different in style from his later‘works that many have thought
it could not have been written by him. 2.ἲ The Life os Agri-
cola. 3. Germany,· a description of the nations os Germany,
which forms our best source of information asto their early
condition. It is about as large awork as the Agricola. 4. ine
