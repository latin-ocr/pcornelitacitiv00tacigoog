12. rutilae comae, etc.: not red, but reddrslr yellow3 in the
Germania, Chap. 4, Tacitus speaks os the rutilae comae, magna
corpora of the Germane. This resemblance serves to support the

among the aborigines oi Britain, such as Tacitus here indicates.

17. ln diversa, in opposite directions: r'.e., towards one another.

participle in the dative (of reference), a common construction in
Greek, is often used in Latin by Livy and the later authors.

20. eorum: i.e., the Gauls.

21. persuasiones: the manuscripts read persuasione; but
while identity of sacred rites, sacra, might prove identity of belief,
persuasiones, the converse would not be the case—ln depos-
cendis, ete: cf. Caes, B. G. iii. 19, ulad bella suscipienda Gallo·
