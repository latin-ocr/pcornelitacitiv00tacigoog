aediles, magistrates of high rank; so, in modern times, burning by
the common hangman.

23. ln comitio ao toro. The comitium was the upper partos
the sorum, towards the Capitoline mount: the words in toro are
added to indicate the publicity of the act.

2. 1. sapientiae, philosophy.-proressorrbus, in the modern
meaning of the word. The teachers oi philosophy were banished
about Ab. 94. - omni bona arte: this relates to the same act, -
by the banishment of the professors‚ every high aspiration in art
and science was driven into exile.

2. occurreret, used without an object, should meet one.- almost
in the modern sense, ocem. Notice that honestum qualifies quid
, as an attribute, anything tlzat is lanarabla‚· quid . . . bonesti would
