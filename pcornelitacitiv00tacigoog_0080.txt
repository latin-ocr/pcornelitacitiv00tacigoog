lATlN PRONUNCIATION

A Brief Outline of the Roman, Continental, and English Methods,
by D. B. Knvu, Adjunct Professor of Latin in Lasayette College.

Contains a few explanatory and historical paragraphs on the
Roman, Continental, and English methods os pronouncing Latin, and
a bries presentation os the main features os each, prepared sor use at
Lasayette College, where the character and arrangement of studies in
English and Comparative Philology make it desirable that students
should have a knowledge of both Roman and English methods.

The students are caresully taught in practice to use the English
method‚ and to give the rules sor the sound ol the letters, this having
been found a valuable aid in teaching English Pronunciation and the
Philology of the English language. Α knowledge os the Roman
method‚ giving the sounds, in the main, as we believe Cicero and
Virgil gave them, is required as a matter ol historical information and
culture, and as an important aid in determining the derivations of
words and laws of phonetic change, andin illustrating the principles
os Comparative Philology. Mailing price, 15 cents. [Ready.
