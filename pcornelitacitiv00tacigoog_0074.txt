CHAPTER XLI.

35. laudantes, not laudatores, which would mean a person
who made this a practice; the participle is strictly temporary,-
those wlzo praese one. This praise is sometimes understood as
ironical, of secret enemies3 it is better to understand it of the
inopportune, although sincere, praise of injudicious friends3 see
optimus quisque libertorum below.

25. 5. limite: this word properly means a path left as a
boundary between two estates3 from this there is anatural transition
to a boundary linc. Under the empire it is used for a fortified
frontier.-ripa: no doubt from what goes before, the banks of
both Rhine and Danube were meant; the special reference is, how·
ever, to the Danube, where the Goths invaded the Roman provinces.

6. possessione, sc. provinciarum—damnis, dative.

7. omnis annus, the whole year.

12. optimus quisque: these were the laudantes referred to
above.

14. deterioribus, neuter.

16. praeceps agebatur: z'.e.‚ to a glory which was his ruin.

CHAPTER XLII.

17. proconsulatum Asiae et Africae. In his previous com-
mands, Aquitania and Britannia, Agricola had acted simply as
legatus or deputy of the emperor, in administering provinces of
which the emperor himself was in theory governor3 it was now his
time to become himself the governor. proconsul, of a senatorial
province (see note, Chap. VII.). This office, in which the gov-
ernor had, in theory, independent power, was superior in dignity to
that of the imperial provinces in which the governor was only a
deputy3 but it was inferior in effective power, because he exer-
cised only civil authority. lt was bestowed, as in the republic, on
men who had held magistracies3 Asia and Africa alone to those
who had been consuls 3 the other nine to past praetors. But, whereas
in the Republie they were given to the magistrates immediately upon
leaving their office, under the empire there must be an interval of
some years-at this period generally thirteen years. (Marquardt,
Riimisclze Staatsverwaltung, i.‚ p. 405.) The office was heldfnt only
a year ata time. (Mommsen, Rimiscltes Stootsrecbtjumstssb
