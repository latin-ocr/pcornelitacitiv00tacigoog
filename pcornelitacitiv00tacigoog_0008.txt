INTRODUCTION.

UBLIUS* CORNELIUS TACITUS‚ the greatest of the
Roman historians, flourished in the reign of the Emperor
Trajan (ab. 98-117). There is no positive evidence as to
the place of his birth, or its date, or the time of his death. A
tradition of no great value makes him a native os Interamna.
This was the birthplace of the Emperor Tacitus, who claimed

kinship with the historian. As to the year of his birth, we know ·

only that he was somewhat older than his intimate friend, the
younger Pliny, who was born nn. 61 or 62. Pliny himself says
(Epp. vii. 20) that they were propemodum acquolcs,· but adds:
adulescentulus, cum som tu soma gloriaque fiores, te sequi. ..
concupiscebam. These expressions may point to a difference in
age of four or five, possibly even eight or ten, years: we can-
not well place the birth of Tacitus earlier than 51 or later than
56. The best authorities are generally agreed upon ab. 54.
Two or three considerations tell in favor os an earlier
date. In the Life of Agricola (Chap. 111.) he appears to reckon
himself among those who, being juoeucs at the accession of
Domitian, had arrived od senectutem under the rule of that
tyrant. Now forty-tive was the age os senectus according to
Roman law 3 and as Domitian died in 96, Tacitus can hardly
have been bom much later than 31. Again, the narration of
