T lee Life eff Agricola. v ·

from the death of Nero, ao. 68, to that os Domitian, Aa). 96.
Only the first four books and part of the fifth are extant.
5. The Annals .· properly an introduction to the Historics, less
full and minute, but ina more finished and maturer style. It
consisted of sixteen books, and embraced the period from the
death of Augustus, ao. 14, to that of Nem, Μ). 68. Four
books and parts of four others are missing. He planned also a
history of the good times alter Domitian, but seems never to
have undertaken it. ¹

Tacitus was in theory a republican, and had no liking for the
empire. He knew very well that the Republic could never be
restored, and was satisfied that the beneficent rule of Nerva and
Trajan had solved the problem of govemment sor the Romans,
and that they now enjoyed the best practicable combination of
liberty and authority. But he could not forg'et the honors of

the evil times that had gone before, and he gives full and unre-
strained expression to his hatred of the tyranny of Tiberius,

Caligula, Nero, and Domitian. His style glows, with intensity
of feeling when he speaks of them3 and he osten rises on these
occasions into a stem and passionate eloquence. This appears
also to have been his characteristic as an orator; for Pliny says
that when engaged in the prosecution of a cruel and unjust
provincial governor, he' spoke eloquentissime et, quod eximium
orooont' ejus inest, ‹repertis-which last word we may render,
“in a stately, eamest style.” As awriter, he had the same char-
acteristics; he excels in graphic power, though he is often ob-
·scure from excessive condensation: but the student is always
repaid sor his efforts by the intrinsic excellence of his writings.
The Life of Agricola stands by itself in ancient literature as
a biography os the modern type—not merely the worthily
related lise of an eminent man, like those o( kkutmdu aser
