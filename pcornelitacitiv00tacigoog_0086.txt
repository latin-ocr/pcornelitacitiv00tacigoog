A GE OME TRl' FOR BE GINNERS.

Adapted to Lower and Grammar School Work. By G. A. Hm,
Harvard University.

The principles which underlie the method employed in this work
are the following :-

1. Geometrical instruction for beginners should proceed from the
’ concrete to the abstract.

2. It should aim to develop the geometric imagination and the
inventive faculty, by making reasonable demands upon the mental
powers of the learner.

3. lt should be practicak- that is to say, it should seize every

Α fitting opportunity to illustrate and explain the uses of Geometry.
