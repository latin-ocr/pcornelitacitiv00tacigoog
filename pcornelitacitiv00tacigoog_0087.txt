xiv ANNOUNCEMENTS OF ΝΜ Boorrs.

Agreeably to the first of these principles, in the beginning the dis-
tinction between a body, a surface‚ a line, anda point, is shown by
the use ol models, and· later they are again employed to give clear
ideas respectjng the regular solids. Many conceptions and simple
relations-such as occur, sor instance, in the subject of parallels, of
perpendiculars, os angles, os intersecting lines and planes, os equal
ligures, of similar ligureS, of polygons, etc-are illustrated by reser-
ence to well-known objects; and a variety of questions are asked,
which the learner can answer by reflecting upon what he has seen.

ln proving theorems, in place os the formal method which begins
with a statement os the theorem and follows with the ploos, unlolded
step by step in syllogistic reasoning, there is often substituted the
method which begins with the study of a figure, and the relations os its
parts, and proceeds to the theorem, hythe comparison and combina-
tion of ideas, much in the same way as the discoverer os the theorem
might have done. Care hasbeen taken to select theorems which are
simple, and which at the same tirne form a basis sor useful problems
and applications.

Special stress has been laid upon the laws of the equality and os
the similarity of triangles3 because, apart from their simple character,
they are the keys to nine-tenths at least os the rest oi Geometry, both
theoretical and practical.

Exercises are appended to almost every section, and to the end of
each chapter, and form one of the chief features of the book. Tbey
are intended to throw the learner on his own resources, and to lead
him to invent and to generalize lor himself.

Among the applications ol Geometry which find a place in the
work, may be mentioned the testing ol vertical and horizontal direc-
tions, drawing lines to scale, the construction of perpendicular lines
andos angles, the application of the laws os the equality and simi·
larity os triangles to the measurement os inaccessible distances, and a
great number and variety of practical exercises upon the computation
of lengths, areas, and volumes.

The present work is adapted to ordinary pupils between the ages
os twelve and sixteen. It forms a suitable introduction to higher
works on the same subject, and at the same time contains that part of
Geometry which every one, women not excepted‚ may study with in·
terest and with much intellectual profit. [Ready in June.
